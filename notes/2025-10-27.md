## Key Takeways

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is teaching a computer to work and solve a task automatically using given data.

How machine learning become important or needed
Initially every single things was handled by Human himself, like given an input convert it to desired output
Then came programming, where human can write a program, which take input and give output. But even with programming there were task or areas where programming was not sufficient or convient. Like Face recognition
Then came Machine learning where a computer can do task which were hard or possible for human and programming. In machine learning we provide computer lots of data related to problem we want to solve and it analysis those data and then make predict for new unseen data.

Applications of Machine Leanring
1. Face Recognition
2. Weather redar
3. Recommendation system
4. Artifical Voice assistants like Alexa and Siri
5. Robots etc
