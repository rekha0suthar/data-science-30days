## Key Takeways

### Probability
Probability is chance of occurance of randomly selected event.

1. We used Contingency table and used Row/Column Relative frequency as Probabiliy of different events.
2. There are different type of Probabilities

    1. **Joint Probability** - Probability of two or more events occuring at same time.

            Notation 𝑃(𝐴 and 𝐵) OR 𝑃(𝐴, 𝐵)

    2. **Marginal Probability** - Probability of single event occuring on its own irrespective ofother events.

            Notation 𝑃(𝐴)
    3. **Condititional Probability** - When occcurance of one event is dependent on other event.

            𝑃(𝐴 | 𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) / 𝑃(𝐵)


3. **Multiplication Rule**

            𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐴 | 𝐵) * 𝑃(𝐵)
4. **Independent Events or Mutually Exclusive events:-** 
Two or more events are mutually exclusive when there is no dependency between them.
        
        𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐴) * 𝑃(𝐵), and 𝑃(𝐴 | 𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐴)
5. **Null or Disjoint events:-**

        𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) = ∅
6. **Rule of Total Probability:-** 

        𝑃(𝐴) = 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵1) + 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵2) + ..... + 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵n)
        B1, B2, ....Bn are mutually exclusive events
7. **Bayes Rule:-**

        𝑃(𝐴 | 𝐵) = 𝑃(𝐴 ∩ 𝐵) / 𝑃(𝐵) 
        𝑃(𝐴 | 𝐵) = (𝑃(𝐵 | 𝐴) * 𝑃(𝐴)) / (𝑃(𝐴) * 𝑃(𝐵 | 𝐴) + 𝑃(𝐴') * 𝑃(𝐵 | 𝐴'))
