# Key Takeways

1. Two type of Numerical Data
    1. Discrete - countable data, as whole no intermediate value in between - like 4, 8, 5,.In Chart each column is separate not connected to other columns - 1, 2, 3
    2. Continuous - infinite data as exist intermediate values in between - like 5.4, 3.5. In Chart columns are connected - 30-40, 40-50
2. Central Tendency for Numerical Data
    1. Mode, Median and Mean. How they affect by Outliers. Mean is most affected one. Adding or Multiplying constant changes these central tendencies
    2. Range - Difference between Maximum and Minimum. Also affected by outliers.
    3. Variance - To find dispersion of datapoints and compare different datasets. Dispersion from central tendency - (xi - u). But to find variance, we square dispersion and take summation of squared dispersion and divide by total number of observation(N), for sample variance divide by (n - 1). Adding constant does not affect variance but multiplying constant changes variance to constant square old variance.
    4. Standard Deviation - Numerical data has Unit associated with them like kg, cm and central tendency have same unit, but for variance this unit get squared, to overcome, this we use Standard deviation. It is squared root of variance. No affect of adding constant and multiply constant changes to constant by old Standard deviaton.
    5. Percentile 

        a. 100p, if np is not an integer then find smallest integer greater than np. 
        b. Percentile is data value positioned at that integer value. If np is an integer then Percentile is data value at average of value at np and np+1.
        c. 25th Percentile is First Quartile. 50th Percentile is Second Quartile or Median. 75th is Third Quartile.
        d. Inter Quartile Range (IQR) - Q3 - Q1
3. Stem and Leaf - Way of arrange data points, in a stem put first digit and second digit in leaf.
