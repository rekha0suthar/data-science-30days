## Key Takeways

### Hypothesis Testing
Using samples to decide between Null hypothesis and Alternative hypothesis.

Ho: Null Hypothesis;

HA: Alternative Hypothesis


#### Acceptance set and test
x1, x2, ...., xn ~ iid X
Subset A of X^n <--> a hypothesis test
if x1, x2, ....., xn E A, we accept Ho, otherwise reject Ho

#### Metric for Hypothesis testing

**Size and Power of a test**
1. Metric 1: Significance Level - also called size, of a test, denoted by ùõº
    
        Type I error: Reject Ho when Ho is true

        ùõº = P(Type I error) = P(Reject Ho | Ho is true)

2. Metric 2: Power of test, 1 - Œ≤

        Type || error: Accept Ho when HA is true
        Œ≤ = P(Type || error)  = P(Accept Ho | HA is true)
        Power = 1 - Œ≤ = P(Reject Ho | HA is true)

Above is paradigm of hypothesis testing is by Nayman and Pearson

### Types of Hypothesis testing
1. Simple hypothesis - A hypothesis that is completely specifies distribution of the samples is called Simple hypothesis.
2. Composite hypothesis - A hypothesis that does not completely specifies distribution of the samples is called Composite hypothesis.

Example: Coin toss

-> Null hypothesis: P(heads) = 0.5 (Coin is fair) --- Simple

-> Alternative: P(Heads) != 0.5 (Coin is unfair) --- Composite

### z-test
Test Statistic, denoted by T

-> some functions of samples

-> sample mean x bar, sample variance S^2

Acceptance and rejection regions are specified through T

Eg. 

    1. Reject Ho if T > c (right)
    2. Reject Ho if T < -c (left)
    3. Reject Ho if |T| > c (two sided)

Significance level ùõº depends on c and the distribution of T | Ho

-> Right Sided: ùõº = P(T > c | Ho)

-> Fix ùõº and find c

Testing for mean (normal samples, known variance)
Reject Ho: T > mean + c or T < mean - c

### P-value
Suppose the test statistic T=t in one sampling. The lowest significance level ùõº at which the Null hypothesis will be rejected for T=t(Critical value) is called P-value of the sampling.

#### What to choose ? Significance level or P-value
Step-1: Decide on null and alternative hypothesis

Step-2: Decide on test statistic T

Step-3: ""Philosophy"" of testing
    
    Choice-1: Pick Signifance level first
    Probability of Type | error can be fixed in some applications. In those case, significance level is easy to fix.
    In many applications, 0.05 or 0.01 is accepted as commpn significance level
    Find rejection region ( find the critical value c abd reject Ho if T > c)

    Choice-2: Pick P-value
    Report the P-value
    If P-value is low enough, choose to reject Ho; otherwise accept HA.
    How low is low enough? Depends on applications and other information.

### t-test, z-test and chi-squared test
1. **The Relationship Between Z and T (When Sample Size is Large)**

   The T-test is the more common and generally safer choice because it uses the sample standard deviation (s), acknowledging that the true population standard deviation (ùúé) is unknown.

   The key to their convergence is the degrees of freedom (df) in the t-distribution.

        T-statistic formula: t = (bar{x} - mu)/ (s /sqrt(n))

        Z-statistic formula: Z = (bar{x} - mu) / (ùúé / sqrt(n))

    The Convergence: As the sample size (n) increases (typically n >= 30), the sample standard deviation (s) becomes a very good estimate of the population standard deviation (ùúé). Consequently, the t-distribution approaches the Z-distribution (Standard Normal Distribution), and the t-statistic essentially becomes equivalent to the Z-statistic.

    In an i.i.d. Normal tutorial: If the sample is large (n>30) and continuous, the tutor might use the Z-test (for its simpler theoretical foundation) or the t-test (for practical accuracy), and the resulting p-values will be nearly identical.

2. **The Relationship with Chi-Square (chi^2)**

    The Chi-square test is based on the sum of squared standard normal variables. This is the theoretical link that allows a continuous, normal dataset to be related to a chi^2 distribution, even though the primary use of the chi^2 test is for categorical data.
    
    How they are mathematically related (The Test of Variance):When working with i.i.d. Normal data, the distribution of the sample variance ($s^2$) is directly related to the chi^2 distribution:
    
                ((n-1) * s^2)/ ùúé^2 ~ chi^2_n-1

    s^2: The sample variance 
    
    ùúé^2: The hypothesized population variance 
    
    n-1: The degrees of freedom
    
    A tutor using continuous, i.i.d. Normal data might use the Chi-square distribution to perform a test on the population variance (ùúé^2).
