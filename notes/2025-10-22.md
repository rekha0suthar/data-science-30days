# Key Takeways

1. Definitation of Data Science - Art of learning from data
2. Data Types
    1. Categorical Data - Eg Data where mathmetical operation cannot applied

        a. Nominal data - where order is important (Name, label, Jersey no.)

        b. Ordinal data - Order is important (t-shirt size s, m, l, xl, Good, average, bad)
    2. Numerical Data

        a. Interval - does not include zero ( rating 1-5)
        
        b. Ratio - (Weight, height, age)

3. Population - Dataset which we want to analysis.
    Sample - Subset of data which represent population

4. Pie Chart  - Used to show share/perportion of each cateogry. Relative frequency used to create chart
Bar Chart - Show comparison of each category, if in sorted order then called Parito chart. Frequency is used to create bar chart.
5. Central Tendency for Categorical Dataset
    1. Mode - Used for both Nominal and Ordinal, a value which appear most frequently
    2. Median - Only for Ordinal data, sort the ordinal data and if total number of entries(n) is odd, then Median is (n + 1) / 2 else n / 2 and (n / 2) + 1
